// Question 19
// Write a computer solution for evaluating the value of sin2
// x according to the formula
// Your computer solution should also return the number of terms needed to evaluate sin2
// x to 1 in
// 1,000,000 together with the value of sin2
// x for a given x with appropriate captions. You must put
// in a check so that your computer solution accepts x as input if only the absolute value of x is less
// than pi/2 .
